Sentiment Analysis Using BERT
This project demonstrates the implementation of a sentiment analysis model using the pre-trained BERT model. The goal is to classify text into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The model is built using the Hugging Face Transformers library and TensorFlow.

Overview
In this project, we fine-tune the BERT model for sentiment analysis tasks. The model is trained on a subset of the Sentiment140 dataset, which consists of tweets with labeled sentiments. The goal is to predict whether a given text is positive, negative, or neutral in sentiment.

Technologies Used
Python (for implementing the model and processing data)

TensorFlow (for model training and evaluation)

Hugging Face Transformers (for using the pre-trained BERT model)

Streamlit (for building a simple web interface)

NLTK (for text preprocessing like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization)

Emoji (for handling emojis in the text)

How to Run the Application

Model Information: The model was fine-tuned using the BERT-base-uncased model from Hugging Face, with a classification layer on top for three sentiment classes.

Model Training
The model was trained using the Sentiment140 dataset (subset of 2000 samples), with the following preprocessing steps applied to the text:

Removing usernames (@username)

Removing URLs

Handling emojis (converted to text)

Removing special characters and numbers

Tokenizing the text and removing stopwords

Lemmatizing the words to their base form

The model was trained for 2 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5.

Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the test set, and the classification report was generated to assess performance. However, due to computational resource limitations, the training was limited to a small subset of the data and a short number of epochs, which resulted in a lower performance score. The full model training was not possible due to resource constraints.

Classification Report:
Due to resource limitations, the final accuracy is suboptimal. However, the model still provides reasonable performance given the constraints.

Known Issues
Low Performance: Due to limited computational resources (memory and processing power), the model was trained on a small subset of the data and for fewer epochs than would be ideal. This resulted in lower accuracy and performance compared to what could be achieved with more resources.

Training Time: Training a model of this size requires significant computational resources (e.g., high-end GPUs), which were unavailable during the project.

Accuracy: The current model may not generalize well on unseen data. Training on a larger dataset with more epochs and better resources would likely improve the model's performance.

Future Improvements
Increase Dataset Size: Training on a larger subset of the Sentiment140 dataset or using a different dataset could improve the model’s ability to generalize.

Increase Training Time: Running the model for more epochs would help it to better learn the underlying patterns in the data.

Use of More Computational Resources: Access to better hardware (e.g., GPUs) would significantly reduce training time and improve model performance.

Model Optimization: Exploring different architectures or fine-tuning hyperparameters could improve the accuracy of the model.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models like BERT for sentiment analysis tasks. However, due to computational limitations, the model’s performance is not optimal. With additional resources, the model’s accuracy can be significantly improved.
